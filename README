== Rails Boost ==

Here is actualy my first attempt to port the entire app on Rails3 beta3.
Still not fully working ... but is a start ;-)
 
   dont forget to "bundle install", after "git clone git@github.com:lgs/railsboost.git"

>>Rails boost is a very simple project based around making it very, very
>>easy to create templates for your Rails 2.3.1+ projects.

>>Stop bootstrapping manually. Stop using old pulls of Rails. Start being
>>more productive.

== Developing ==

1) git clone git@github.com:lgs/railsboost.git
2) bundle install
3) rake db:migrate
4) rake commands:load ( which grabs all of the commands from the remote server )
5) rails s
