== Rails Boost ==

Here is actualy my first attempt to port the entire app on Rails3 beta3.
Still not fully working ... but is a start ;-)

>>Rails boost is a very simple project based around making it very, very
>>easy to create templates for your Rails 2.3.1+ projects.

>>Stop bootstrapping manually. Stop using old pulls of Rails. Start being
>>more productive.

== Developing ==

0) Get the code from http://github.com/hcatlin/railsboost/tree/master
1) Migrate the DB
2) Execute `rake commands:load` which grabs all of the commands from the remote server
3) Read the TODO file
4) Start hacking!
